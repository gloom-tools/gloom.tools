    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <div class="tldr">
      <p class="tldr-label">TL;DR</p>
      <p>Don't be a jerk. Don't use our tools to harm people. Pay for what you use. We'll do our best to keep things running. This is a legal document, but we've tried to make it readable.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Agreement</h2>
    <p>
      By using Gloom products (websites, tools, services), you agree to these terms. If you're using Gloom on behalf of a company, you're agreeing on their behalf and promising you have the authority to do so. If you don't agree, don't use our stuff.
    </p>

    <h2>What we provide</h2>
    <p>
      Gloom makes security tools for engineers. Some are free and open source. Some are paid services. Some run locally on your machine. Some run on our infrastructure. The specific terms depend on which product you're using, but these general terms apply to all of them.
    </p>

    <h2>Your responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Be honest:</strong> Don't misrepresent who you are or what you're doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Be legal:</strong> Don't use our tools to break laws. Don't use them to harm people. Don't use them to harass, stalk, or abuse anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Be reasonable:</strong> Don't try to break our systems. Don't spam. Don't reverse engineer our paid products to avoid paying. Don't use automated systems to abuse our services.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Keep your credentials safe:</strong> If you have an account, you're responsible for what happens with it. Use a strong password. Tell us if you think someone got in.
    </p>

    <h2>Open source</h2>
    <p>
      Some of our tools are open source under the MIT License. For those, the MIT License governs what you can do with the code. You can read it, modify it, distribute it, use it commercially — the usual MIT stuff. These Terms of Service apply to our hosted services and paid products, not to your own use of open source code.
    </p>

    <h2>Paid services</h2>
    <p>
      If you pay for Gloom products:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Billing:</strong> We charge in advance. Prices are in USD unless stated otherwise. We'll tell you before we change prices.</li>
      <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Generally, we don't do refunds for time already paid. But if something's broken and we can't fix it, we'll make it right.</li>
      <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You can cancel anytime. Your access continues until the end of your paid period.</li>
      <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> Prices don't include taxes. If we're required to collect them, we will.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data and privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> explains what data we collect and how we use it. It's part of these terms. The short version: we collect very little and we don't sell anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Your data is yours.</strong> We don't claim ownership of your content or data. You can export it. You can delete it. If you stop using our services, we'll delete your data after a reasonable period unless you ask us to do it sooner.
    </p>

    <h2>Uptime and reliability</h2>
    <p>
      We try to keep things running. We don't guarantee 100% uptime because that's not realistic. We'll do our best to fix problems quickly. For paid enterprise customers, we may offer specific SLAs — those will be in a separate agreement.
    </p>
    <div class="legal-note">
      <strong>Real talk:</strong> We're a small team. We're not going to promise five nines of uptime. We will promise to care deeply when things break and fix them fast.
    </div>

    <h2>Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
    <p>
      Our services are provided "as is." We don't make warranties about them being perfect, uninterrupted, or error-free. We don't promise they'll meet your specific needs. Use your judgment about whether they're right for you.
    </p>
    <div class="legal-note">
      <strong>In legal terms:</strong> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, GLOOM DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
    </div>

    <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      If something goes wrong, our liability is limited to what you paid us in the 12 months before the problem. We're not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. We're not liable for lost profits, lost data, or business interruption.
    </p>
    <div class="legal-note">
      <strong>In plain terms:</strong> We'll refund what you paid if we really screw up. We won't pay for downstream consequences. This is standard for software services — not because we don't care, but because we can't predict or control how you use our tools.
    </div>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>
      You can stop using our services anytime. We can terminate your access if you violate these terms or if we need to (for legal reasons, security reasons, or because we're shutting down a product). If we terminate for cause, you don't get a refund. If we terminate for our convenience, we'll refund any unused prepaid fees.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to these terms</h2>
    <p>
      We might update these terms. If we make significant changes, we'll let you know — email, blog post, something visible. If you keep using our services after changes take effect, you're agreeing to the new terms.
    </p>

    <h2>Governing law</h2>
    <p>
      These terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, United States. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of Delaware. If that's a problem for you, let us know and we'll try to work something out.
    </p>

    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Entire agreement:</strong> These terms (plus our Privacy Policy and any product-specific terms) are the whole agreement. Anything we said before that contradicts this doesn't count.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Severability:</strong> If part of this is unenforceable, the rest still applies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>No waiver:</strong> If we don't enforce something once, we can still enforce it later.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Assignment:</strong> You can't transfer your account to someone else without our permission. We can transfer the agreement if we're acquired or merge with someone.
